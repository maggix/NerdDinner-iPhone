NerdDinner-iPhone is an implementation of an OData-based iPhone client for NerdDinner.com

Please note: to me, this is a test/playground environment.

This software includes portions of code from other sources, in particular Matt Gallagher, MBProgressHUD project on GitHub and Microsoft's OData Library for iPhone (on GitHub as well).
